# TCP-Console-Application-bank-application-Server-and-Client-Sides
It is an application using the TCP socket protocol with a server and a client side. The client side is designed for users to input their username, password, and the operation they wish to perform. On the other hand, the server side is where all the banking transactions take place.

Download the "Client" and "Server" rar files and extract their contents. Afterwards, you can start using the extracted files by running the .sln files. These compressed files were written with Visual Studio 2022 version.
